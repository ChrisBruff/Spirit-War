# Spirit-War

## How to Play:

Compile the program: Open the "Spirit_Wars.cpp" file in your C++ compiler, compile the program, and run it.

## Game Rules:

1. Each player starts with one life and zero charges.

2. Players take turns making a move by choosing from the available options.

3. There are five moves: Charge, Block, Shot, Spirit Block, and Spirit Bomb.

4. Charges are needed to perform any attack or defense moves.

5. You need one charge to perform a Shot, which can be blocked by a Block or a Spirit Block.

6. Spirit Block is an advanced defense that can deflect any attack directed at you and block a Spirit Bomb.

7. Spirit Bomb requires three charges to execute, and it is the only move that can kill your opponent.

8. The game ends when one player loses all of their life.

## Game Setup:

- Each player must enter their name to start the game.

- Players cannot have the same name.

- The game will randomly select the first player to make a move.

> Making a Move:

When it is your turn, you must choose a move from the available options by entering the corresponding number (1-5) in the console.

If you select an invalid move number, the program will ask you to try again.

If you select Shot, Spirit Block, or Spirit Bomb, you must have enough charges to execute the move.

If you do not have enough charges to execute the move, the program will ask you to choose a different move.

> Game Progress:

Once both players have made their move, the program will execute the moves and update the game status.

If one player loses all of their life, the game ends, and the other player wins.

If both players survive, the program will randomly select the next player to make a move, and the game continues.

> Exiting the Game:

You can exit the game at any time by closing the console window.
